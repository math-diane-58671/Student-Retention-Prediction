# Student-Retention-Prediction
Machine learning model predicting at-risk students to improve retention and success rates.

## Overview
This project uses LASSO, Random Forest, and Neural Additive Models to identify at-risk students based on demographic, academic, and engagement features. The goal is to help institutions intervene early and improve retention rates.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with handling of missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for categorical and continuous variables
- Model training & hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, dnamite)
- Google Colab Notebook for EDA and modeling
- SMOTE for class imbalance handling
